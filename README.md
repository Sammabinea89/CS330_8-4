This web application will give a user-friendly interface for searching a database. The major goal of this application is to reunite trained rescue dogs with their perfect breed, sex, and age. The project consists of three components: a database, an API, and an interactive dashboard. Reasons For this product, in particular, we relied on Mongo DB, which has an easy-to-learn interface for Python users and enables the quick generation of databases from a CSV file. Python is compatible with database systems such as SQL, but the syntax is so different that switching between them may be laborious and time-consuming. The selection tools for executing simple CRUD tasks in an SQL database are much more complicated than in a MongoDB when Python is utilized. First, the dashboard's versatility makes DashDash an excellent option for development. 

	This was the rationale for utilizing DashDash. Dash, which uses the JavaScript programming language, offers an incredibly responsive foundation. HTML Dash components allow you to control the outputs to segments. Once that is completed, the app callback process will alter any of the recognized target inputs by the established instructions. You can start the InitiativeFollow these procedures to create a local clone of this software. The first step is to create a Mongo database. The second step is to construct a CRUD module in Python so that you can access the database. Finally, you'll need to build a Dash web app that uses the Python CRUD module. This application's multi-layered architecture allows it to respond immediately to database modifications.
